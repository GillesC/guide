# Wireless Communication
The motherboards host a LoRaWAN modem to provide a wireless connection.
LoRaWAN is a Low-Power Wide-Area Network technology allowing to wirelessly transmit small amaount of data over a large range.

Such a network consist of end-devices which communicate with gateways. These gateways relay the messages to the cloud:

In this project, we use the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) (TTN) system.
Everyone can add gateways to this network in order to extend the network.
In case there is no coverage by the TTN, we will provide a LoRaWAN network.
