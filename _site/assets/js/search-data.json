    "content": "These pages contain the technical documentation of the Dramco IoT with a Soft Touch (IWAST) project. It focuses on simplicity to integrate sensors for educational purposes. . An application, running locally on a computer, is used to configure the mother board. More specifically, the mother board notifies the client application of the connected sensors. Based on the configuration file of each sensor –hosted online– the client application allows to configure the update frequency of each sensor and corresponding parameters. . Client App &lt;--&gt; Motherboard &lt;--&gt; sensor &lt;--&gt; sensor &lt;--&gt; sensor . Terminology . Sensor | The sensor denotes the whole sensor board. | .

    "content": "Some sensors are able to generate an interupt when a certain metric value is exceeded. When enabled, you will receive an update of the metric value if the threshold is exceeded. . We allow to define two thresholds, i.e., threshold low and threshold high. When a metric value exceeds the threshold high (TH) an interrupt is generated. In contrast, only when a metric value goes below threshold low (TL) an interrupt occurs. This allow us to get updates in three distinct manners. . In all cases an interrupt is generated when the metric value exceeds TH or when is falls below TL. When playing with the TH and TL configuration we can manipulate when we want an update. . If we are interested when a value is higher than TH or lower than TL, we define: TH with a higher value as TL. . | If we are interested when a value enters the area between TH and TL, TL has a higher value than TH. . | If we want to know when a metric value differs from a specific value, we can define THequal to TL. . | .",
